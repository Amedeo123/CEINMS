Neuromusculoskeletal models used in CEINMS
==========================================

What follows is a description of the all the various EMG-informed models that have been included in CEINMS. I have developed and implemented in CEINMS two different models of the activation dynamics, which convert the neural drive to the muscle activation76, and three models of the muscle contraction dynamics, which represent the transformation between the muscle activation and muscle kinematics in force (:num:`Fig. #calibration`).
