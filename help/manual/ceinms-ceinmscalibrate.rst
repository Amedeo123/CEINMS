Using CEINMScalibrate
#####################

- what you use ceinms-calibrate for ( see the theory)
- recap of what you need: see config files, see prepare your data
- explain the actual meaning of some configs we didn't go into detail in the config files section
- some considerations about time vs accuracy tradeoff and the curse of dimensionality (old but gold)
- explain that all params can be calibrated, but we only suggest to calibrate some - which and why (give the impression we understand what we are doing)
- output file: give some hints for sanity checks (are the parameters close to the boundaries? - maybe we could add some check in the code for that)
